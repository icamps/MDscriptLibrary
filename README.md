# MDscriptLibrary

These scripts are intended to be used with MDAnalyis package (version 2.0.0-dev0) to do several analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations.

**Note**: you need to have the topology and trajectories files from you preferable MD package.

If you don't know the segment names, you can use the script *get_segment_names* to identify them. With the segment names of the protein, ligand and solvent, you add them to the main script *doMDAnalysis*.

The script *doMDAnalysis* will carry RMSD, RMSF, RadGyr, 2D-RMSD and PCA analysis, saving CSV files (to be used with your favorite plotting software and their respective images (in PNG format). In the *example* folder you will find some images files to be used just as a guide, not as final/production images.
